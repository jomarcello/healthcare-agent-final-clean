# ü§ñ LEADSPRINT AI AGENT - HEALTHCARE AUTOMATION INSTRUCTIONS

## üîß CRITICAL FIXES IMPLEMENTED

### ‚úÖ ElevenLabs API Turn Timeout Fix
**ISSUE**: ElevenLabs API validation error - "Turn timeout must be -1 or between 1 and 300 seconds"
**SOLUTION**: Changed `turn_timeout: 10000` to `turn_timeout: 10` (API expects seconds, not milliseconds)
**LOCATION**: `autonomous-agent.js` line 720
```javascript
turn: {
  turn_timeout: 10  // FIXED: Was 10000 (milliseconds), now 10 (seconds)
}
```
